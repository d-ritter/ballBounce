This is a tutorial for my art students to learn intermediate P5*JS. Arrays, and for loops. 
Link to the code and resources can be found on Git.

A Google Slide presentation that I created for this project can be found here: https://bit.ly/ballBounc-p5js

This tutorial was inspired by the free Codecademy

Daniel Shiffman who is one of my favorite mentors also inspired me to learn Processing, and now P5* a few years ago now. His series on learning P5* is a great resource!

Check out the Coding Train or his video series on P5*JS.
